                <p>My name is Ramollo Samuel Tumisang. I am 31 years old. Still living with my mom but spended most of my years with my grandma. I always act more mature than my age. I have had a lot of people invest in me academically, so I have tried my
                    outmost in most of my classes. My hobbies include music, reading and traveling. Although I donâ€™t get to travel much. I am generally pleased with my life.</p>
                <p>I grew up in a place/village called Madidi in North West. Spended most of my life there, up until i completed my matric in 2008. I moved there late 2008 and started to live with my mom at Olievenhoutbosch. 2009 enrolled at DSDC college
                    for a year. Due to the fact that i had a baby girl, i had to drop out and start taking responsibility of my actions. I became a security guard for nine years. 2020, I took a gap year trying to find myself.
