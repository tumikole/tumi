# Inrtroduction

Today im going to talk about what i have been doing for the passed weeks. The passed weeks it was hectic for me beacause i was busy building THECODINGGROUND WEBSITE which consumed most of my time.

# Body 

The TCG website was challenging because building a website from scratch and making sure that everything is on point it is not an easy task. But i have learned a lot from building THECODINGGROUND  website. The project was given to us the junior student and everyone has his/her own page to build. On the website we had to add student, mentors and contact pages from the previous TCG website and also modify the layout/structure of the website. On the website i had to modify the home page and also add the registration form and connect with the formspree so that when someone is registering we can get the credentials of someone who is applying. On the forms (contact, registration) i added javascript so that we can connect the formspree and our forms.

Another thing is i added the footer which has the sponsors icons, and the icons act in a form of links, so you easily visit  our sponsors websites.

# Conclusion

In conclusion i would like to thank Tanille, Jason and Moral for giving us this opportunity to build THECODINGGROUND website because we have learned a lot from it.
