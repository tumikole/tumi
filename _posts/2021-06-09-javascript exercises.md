I have learned so much about the arithmetic operators. Operation operates on two numbers.

## Arithmetic Operators

The two numbers can be literals or variables. 
The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.
The operation is defined by an operator.

### What are Arithmetic Operators

#### Addition (+)

var x = 7;
var y = 4;
var z = x + y;

#### Subtraction (-) 

var x = 7;
var y = 4;
var z = x - y;

#### Multiplication (*)

var x = 7;
var y = 4;
var z = x * y;

#### Exponentiation (**)

var x = 7;
var z = x ** 4; 

#### Division (/)

var x = 7;
var y = 4;
var z = x / y;

#### Modulus (Remainder) (%)

var x = 7;
var y = 4;
var z = x % y;


#### Increment (++)

var x = 7;
x++;
var z = x;

#### Decrement (--)

var x = 7;
x--;
var z = x;
