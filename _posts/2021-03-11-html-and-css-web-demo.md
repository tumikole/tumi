## Experience i got today

Today i learned to create a webpage on my own without google or refering to somewhere else. I learned to create styles and structuring web on my own. Even though there were so many warnings and errors but i managed to do it on my own. Even

The most difficult thing i came across today was how to style or position my header and footer. My header wasnt in a fixed or sticky position and my footer was not at the end of the page so i struggled to do so. But at the end i have managed to get them right.

## Freecodecamp

I didnt get to freecodecamp due to the fact that i was busy and struggling with the webpage.
