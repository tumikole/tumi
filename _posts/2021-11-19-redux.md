# Introduction

Redux is a state management library. Redux create initial state, define action types. Define action creators. Create reducers. Change initial state and pass the parameters to the creator function and the reducers.

# Body

## Initializing State

There are two ways to initialize state

1. The createStore method can accept an optional preloadedState value as its second argument.
2. Reducers can also specify an initial value by looking for an incoming state argument that is undefined, and returning the value they'd like to use as a default.

## actionTypes

An action type is a user-defined value that further defines the action category.  

### The action types can be organized into two groups:

1. Direct manipulation of the store. UPDATE_RESOURCES and DELETE_RESOURCES allow you to synchronously modify the store, independent of requests.
2. The rest of the action types are for requests. Within the request action types, there are four groups of action types, one for each of the four CRUD actions. Within each CRUD action "group," the four action types reflect the four request statuses.
