#### learning arrays

Arrays can be nested with one another. Always start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket and put a comma between each entry. You can also nest arrays within other arrays, example:[["food", 60], ["drinks", 15]]

Indexes are used to access data inside arrays. Array indexes they specify an entry in the array. You can push an array using .push to push it to the end of an array.
