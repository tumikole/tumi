## Why do we use connect () function?

The connect() function connects a React component to a Redux store. It provides its connected component with the pieces of the data it needs from the store, and the functions it can use to dispatch actions to the store.

function connect(mapStateToProps?, mapDispatchToProps?, mergeProps?, options?)

The mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps deals with your Redux storeâ€™s state and dispatch, respectively. state and dispatch will be supplied to your mapStateToProps or mapDispatchToProps functions as the first argument.

The returns of mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps are referred to internally as stateProps and dispatchProps, respectively. They will be supplied to mergeProps, if defined, as the first and the second argument, where the third argument will be ownProps. The combined result, commonly referred to as mergedProps, will then be supplied to your connected component.
