## Steps for Converting Iterative Code to Recursive

Identify the main loop
Use the loop condition as the base case and the body of the loop as the recursive case.
The local variables in the iterative version turn into parameters in the recursive version.
Compile and rerun tests.

## Is a for loop recursive?

Loops are very much not recursion. In fact, they are the prime example of the opposite mechanism: iteration. The point of recursion is that one element of processing calls another instance of itself.

## What is a recursive loop?

A recursive loop is said to have occurred when a function, module or an entity keeps making calls to itself repeatedly, thus forming an almost never-ending loop. Recursive constructs are used in several algorithms like the algorithm used for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem.

## What are the two types of recursion?

Recursion are mainly of two types depending on whether a function calls itself from within itself or more than one function call one another mutually. The first one is called direct recursion and another one is called indirect recursion.

## What is the point of recursion

Recursion is made for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems. It is especially good for working on things that have many possible branches and are too complex for an iterative approach. One good example of this would be searching through a file system.

# Conclusion

Recursion is great for when we want to perform the same action over and over. The only that will change when we repeat the action will be the data involved. That's because many of the techniques we use for iteration, such as for loops , while loops , etc.
