## Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-PlacePassed

We use apply() to compute the maximum value in an array.

Spread syntax (...) allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.

Spread syntax can be used when all elements from an object or array need to be included in a list of some kind. 

When we invoke the function, we pass it all the values in the array using the spread syntax and the array name â€” ...numbers.

## spread operator is useful for many different routine tasks in JavaScript, including the following

Copying an array.
Concatenating or combining arrays.
Using Math functions.
Using an array as arguments.
Adding an item to a list.
Adding to state in React.
Combining objects.
Converting NodeList to an array.
