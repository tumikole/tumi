## Regular expressions

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. 
In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. 
These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String. 

### Creating a regular expression

#### You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:

Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes.

ex:
let regex = /ab+c/;

Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object.

ex:
let regex = new RegExp('ab+c');


A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as /abc/, or a combination of simple and special characters, such as /ab*c/ or /Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/.
