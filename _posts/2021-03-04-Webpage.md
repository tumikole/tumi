I have learned so much about structuring the webpage. Struggled when coming to create nav-bar icons. Using links was the best  thing i learned today. Im able to to create pages and link the pages. Styling structure still giving me problems but im getting there. I have learned how to create different types of card and use text inside of those card. Social media icons i managed to to create them and also link then to the direct links.
