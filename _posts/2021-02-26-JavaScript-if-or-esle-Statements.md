## I have learned that JavaScript has only three primitive data types which are String, Number, and Boolean. Everything else (if it’s not null or undefined) can have properties added to it. When you set a variable’s value, and you haven’t declared it to be a variable for the current function scope via the var keyword, JavaScript assumes you mean this.propertyName

### The if/else statement

The if statement enables your program to selectively execute other statements, based on some criteria.

### Order statement

Order is important in if, else if statements. Change the order of logic in the function so that it will return the correct statements in all cases.

### Logical order in if esle statement

The execution of functions from top to bottom.

### Chaining statement

Chained if else statements work on a single value at a time. You can’t use these chained if…else statements in a vectorized way. For that, you can nest multiple ifelse statements

### Switch Statement

Switch statement can have a number of possible execution paths. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered. you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found

### Golf code

Golf code has par and strokes.Golf code return the correct string accordingly to the table which lists the strokes in order of priority, from top to bottom.

### Buiding object in javaScript

Object uses indexex to access and modify data. You access data through what we call properties. In a JS object, all property keys are strings.
Dot notation only lets you access the explicit key name of a property.

### Ways of accessing properties

1. Dot notation
2. Bracket notation

## Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object

If the property which you are trying to delete does not exist, delete will not have any effect and will return true. Any property declared with let or const cannot be deleted from the scope within which they were defined. When a property is marked as non-configurable, delete won't have any effect, and will return false.
