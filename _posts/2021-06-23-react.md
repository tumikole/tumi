# Introduction

Today i'm gonna talk about the main reasons why we use React framework for javascript

# Body

## What is React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for
building user interfaces or UI components. It lets you compose complex UIs
from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

## What is JavaScript react used for?

React js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

## How do you write a JavaScript react?

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements. You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.

# Conclusion

Both HTML and CSS are integral to any web development project. If you have these skills already, then learning React should be a relatively straightforward process. It has its own unique set of challenges, but it is an excellent tool to have in order to start or further your career as a web developer.
