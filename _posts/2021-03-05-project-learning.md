## Problem faced

Today i have learned to insert nav bar and on the webpage and put links on the footet. Creating icons was the difficult thing i have ever done today, but with the help of my fellow classmate i have managed to overcome this problem. 

So today i have learned that in order to create webpage you need the following: 
browser compatibility
screen resolutions
web technologies
internet speed

I was having trouble trying to inspect my project today. 

## 

Also need to know that there are external links and internal links. External  links are the one that you copy from the browser and use them on your coding machine. Internal links are the sources/local links from your coding machine.

I have learned that you can import media files from the internet and also on the internet.

Also that your font text on the webside should be visible enough for the reader to can see. Not using to many colors on your webpage makes your webpage be nice and clean. Not leaving to much white space on your webpage also makes your work clean and proffisional.
