# Introduction

Today i'm gonna be discussing about the redux as how it is an important framework for javascript...

# Body

## What is Redux and why use it?

Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test. While it's mostly used as a state management tool with React, you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library.

## Is Redux frontend or backend?

It should be clear that Redux can be used for the client side (frontend) with user interfaces. However, since Redux is just JavaScript, it can also be used on the server side (backend).

## What problem does Redux solve?

Redux provides a solution by ensuring that: Your state is wrapped in a store which handles all updates and notifies all code that subscribes to the store of updates to the state.

## Is Redux difficult to learn?

It's not exclusive to Javascript. It's present and widely used in most most modern languages. What makes Redux hard is that it's forced on newbies almost as if it's a part of React. Just use setState until you're comfortable, know more JS, and can see why you'd need Redux.
