# JAvascript Methods

A method is a function which is a property of an object. JavaScript functions themselves are objects, so, in that context, a method is actually an object reference to a function.

JavaScript has one complex data type, the Object data type, and it has five simple data types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, and Null. These simple data types are immutable (cannot be changed), while objects are mutable (can be changed).

## Why use JavaScript methods

JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

## What are JavaScript objects

An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.
