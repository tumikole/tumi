## Reverse a String

Need to take the string and reverse it. After iterating through all the characters in the string, you return the new string.

## Factorialize a Number

The final value returned will be the product of all the numbers between  and the number (inclusive). If you initialize the value for the product to 1, then think how you could start at the given number and continue decrementing this number until a specific value while multiplying the product by the number at each step.

Function is always said to “have returned”.
The first returned value can be visualized better if you think about those parenthesis operations you did in secondary school where you do the math inside every parenthesis from inside out, bracket and square bracket until you get a final result.
