# JSON API's and AJAX

## What is difference between JSON and AJAX

The main difference between AJAX and JSON is that AJAX is a set of various technologies, which are used to launch asynchronous HTTP requests to a server using various data formats, such as JavaScript, XML, HTML, plain text or even JSON. JSON is a format which can be used by AJAX for data exchange.

## What is JSON API used for


JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is an encoding scheme that is designed to eliminate the need for an ad-hoc code for each application to communicate with servers that communicate in a defined way. JSON API module exposes an implementation for data stores and data structures, such as entity types, bundles, and fields. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

## How do I use an API

Start Using an API
Most APIs require an API key. 
The easiest way to start using an API is by finding an HTTP client online, like REST-Client, Postman, or Paw. 
The next best way to pull data from an API is by building a URL from existing API documentation.

## Can AJAX use JSON

According to the AJAX model, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and the behavior of the existing page. ... Many developers use JSON to pass AJAX updates between the client and the server.

## How does JSON look like

A JSON object is a key-value data format that is typically rendered in curly braces. ... Key-value pairs have a colon between them as in "key" : "value" . Each key-value pair is separated by a comma, so the middle of a JSON looks like this: "key" : "value", "key" : "value", "key": "value" .08
