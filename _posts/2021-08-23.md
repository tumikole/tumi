# React

## Introduction

React.js is a specific JavaScript framework that web developers use in order to make the process of building interactive elements more streamlined. It is an important tool for building both websites and mobile apps.

## Body

In essence, React is a versatile tool that is used by web developers to build user interfaces or UIs. This includes search bars, dropdown menus, page buttons, and any other site components that a user can engage with.

One of the big things that sets React JS apart is the fact that it allows developers to create single-page applications that use a minimal amount of memory 'Virtual DOM'. React helps developers build sleek, efficient, and dynamic web applications.

It Teaches You JavaScript. It is helpful to have at least a basic understanding of the syntax of JavaScript. Even if you don't, learning React can also help you understand and become comfortable with coding in JavaScript.

In addition, React has a shorter learning curve because it is an overall smaller framework than other options like Angular. Learning React first allows you to only pick up the pieces that you need as you go along rather than becoming inundated with multiple concepts.
