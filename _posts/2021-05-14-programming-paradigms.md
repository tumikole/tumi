## Programming Paradigms

A way of classifying programming language according to the style of computer programming.

### Functional Programming

Is a coding style (how you write your code or organizing your code). Is kind of a mindset you can get into (a way of thinking about a problem or approaching a task).

#### Advantages

1. It is a lot easier to learn.
2. It is safe and easier to debug
3. Allows you to upgrade without stopping the live system
4. Allows for machine-assisted proofs and optimization

#### Disadvantages

1. Combining functions into a complete application very hard
2. Recursion doesnâ€™t feel natural for most programmers.
3. If you are using only immutable values and recursion they potentially lead to performance problems.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Is a style of programming and not always a requirement of your application to make it work correctly. Are the ones that built inside themselves. They are strictly bound to an object instance or directly to a class.

#### Advantages

1. It makes your code modular and is easier to share.
2. It avoids certain value collusions and in certain software that you are creating.
3. It makes your specialized functions reusable.
4. It takes a little bit more processing power for the server to be able to call a class file into a script and then code against it.
5. It provides data security.
6. Data abstraction separates object specification and objects implementation.

#### Disadvantages

1. Has more lines of code more than a functional program.
2. Object-Oriented Programming is much slower than functional Programming as they require more instructions to be executed.
3. It is not suitable for all types of programming.
4. To convert a real-world problem into Object-Oriented Programming is difficult.
5. Object-Oriented Programming software development debugging and testing is not standardized.
