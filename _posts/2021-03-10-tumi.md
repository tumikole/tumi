# Arrays

Assign the first two elements to two random variables.
Set the remaining part of the array to ...arr.
Use destructuring to create the arr variable:

(Freecodecamp)
function removeFirstTwo(list) {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  const [arr] = list; // change this
  // change code above this line
  return arr;
}

then you spread the list parameter values into arr.

const source = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
function removeFirstTwo(list) {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  const [a, b, ...arr] = list;
  // change code above this line
  return arr;
}

In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.

#### Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand

 Was the easiest one because all you had to do was to remove the colons and duplicated names.

#### Declarative Functions

 You have to remove colons and funtion.

#### Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object

In JavaScript, accessor properties are methods that get or set the value of an object. For that, we use these two keywords:

get - to define a getter method to get the property value
set - to define a setter method to set the property value
