#### Arrays

Arrays can be nested with one another. Always start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket and put a comma between each entry. You can also nest arrays within other arrays, example:[["food", 60], ["drinks", 15]]

#### Indexes

Indexes are used to access data inside arrays. Array indexes they specify an entry in the array. 

#### Manupulating Arrays

You can change data in an array using .push to push or .pop and .unshift it to the end of an array as .shift removes the first element.

#### Variable Scope

In JavaScript there are two types of scope: Local and Global.

>Global variables are those declared outside of a block
>Local variables are those declared inside of a block

#### JavaScript Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to decide the flow of execution based on different conditions. If a condition is true, you can perform one action and if the condition is false, you can perform another action.

#### Comparison
 
 Double equals (==) is a comparison operator, which transforms the operands having the same type before comparison. 
 
 Triple equals(===) is a strict equality comparison operator in JavaScript, which returns false for the values which are not of a similar type. This operator performs type casting for equality.

==	Equal to: true if the operands are equal.

!=	Not equal to: true if the operands are not equal.	

===	Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type.

!==	Strict not equal to: true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all.

<	Greater than: true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.	

>=	Greater than or equal to: true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

<	Less than: true if the left operand is less than the right operand.	

<=	Less than or equal to: true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
