# Test

## Introduction

Programming is writing computer code to create a program, in order to solve a problem. Programs consist of instructions to tell a computer exactly what to do and how to do it.

## Body

The test wasnt that hard, we were instructed that we should create an app that has a read me file, i did create a read me file but i forgot to write the instruction on how to execute my app. We had to create a new repository and create a website about the South African big five that will allow people to view details of the South African Big 5 animals. We were instructed to insert 5 pictures of the big five animals which was the simplest thing to do. Displaying the information when clicking the animal picture was the hardest thing to do.

I managed to insert the audios to the pictures but i failed to make them play the sound on hover, the only thing that i did was when you click the picture, the sound plays.

## Conclution

The challenge that i faced today taught me so much that i have to put more efford and challenge myself in every way.
