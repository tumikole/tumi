## What is jquery

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

## Jquery link

  <script src="/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>

  or

   <script src = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

## Jquery Selectors

To use one of these selectors, type a dollar sign and parentheses after it: $(). This is shorthand for the jQuery() function. Inside the parentheses, add the element you want to select. You can use either single- or double-quotes. After this, add a dot after the parentheses and the method you want to use.

In jQuery, the class and ID selectors are like those in CSS. If you want to select elements with a certain class, use a dot (.) and the class name. If you want to select elements with a certain ID, use the hash symbol (#) and the ID name. Note that HTML is not case-sensitive, therefore it is best practice to keep HTML markup and CSS selectors lowercase.
