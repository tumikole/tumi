## Indexing Multidimensional Arrays

Many of the concepts that apply to two-dimensional matrices extend to multidimensional arrays as well.

To access a single element of a multidimensional array, use integer subscripts. Each subscript indexes a dimension--the first indexes the row dimension, the second indexes the column dimension, the third indexes the first page dimension, and so on.

## Manipulating Arrays

### The push and pop methods insert and remove variables from the end of an array.

#### The Push function 

-We use .push()
-It pushes to the end of an array.

#### The Pop function

-We use .pop()
-It removes the las t element from an array and return that element

### Using shifting and unshifting

The unshift and shift methods are similar to push and pop, only they work from the beginning of the array. We can use the push and shift methods consecutively to utilize an array as a queue.

#### The Shift

The shift method will remove the variables of the array in the exact order they were inserted in,


#### The unshift

The unshift method is used to insert a variable at the beginning of an array.

-We use .unshift
-It adds the element to the beggining of an array.
