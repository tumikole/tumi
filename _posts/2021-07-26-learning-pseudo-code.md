# Introduction

Pseudo code is a way of expressing an algorithm without confirming to specific syntax rules. You can easily communicate ideas and concepts to other programmers even though they may be using different languages.

Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language. Pseudocode is sometimes used as a detailed step in the process of developing a program. It allows designers or lead programmers to express the design in great detail and provides programmers a detailed template for the next step of writing code in a specific programming language. Pseudocode

Because pseudocode is detailed yet readable, it can be inspected by the team of designers and programmers as a way to ensure that actual programming is likely to match design specifications. Catching errors at the pseudocode stage is less costly than catching them later in the development process. Once the pseudocode is accepted, it is rewritten using the vocabulary and syntax of a programming language. Pseudocode is sometimes used in conjunction with computer-aided software engineering-based methodologies.

It is possible to write programs that will convert a given pseudocode language into a given programming language.

Examples:

1. If student's grade is greater than or equal to 60

Print "passed"
else
Print "failed"
2. Set total to zero

Set grade counter to one

While grade counter is less than or equal to ten

Input the next grade
Add the grade into the total
Set the class average to the total divided by ten

Print the class average.

3. initialize passes to zero

initialize failures to zero

initialize student to one

while student counter is less than or equal to ten

input the next exam result
if the student passed
add one to passes
else

add one to failures
add one to student counter

print the number of passes

print the number of failures

if eight or more students passed

print "raise tuition"
