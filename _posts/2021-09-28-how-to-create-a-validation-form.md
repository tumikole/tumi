# Introduction

Today i'm going to talk about how to validate the form in react.

# Body

First of all we need to understand what is validation in a form. It is the process of checking/ensuring if the provided data by end user is correct or not. If it is not correct or if it's invalid data then we will restrict it and show the appropriate error messages as per field/requirement so that the user will behave to provide the correct/valid data.

Inline validation is a wonderful way to reduce friction in forms. It’s important that the user knows what they’re doing wrong. If they can’t tell, it’s going to be a frustrating experience. If your user experience is frustrating, you’re going to be leaking a lot of potential registrations.

Be nice when communicating errors. when getting the exact same page but with an error message, the user will feel they have made little or no progress, despite having typed 90% of the form fields correctly.

To start, don’t use words with a negative tone. Things like, “oops,” “failed,” and “wrong.”. You should also provide positive reinforcement when a user gets something right. When you ask for a phone number, don’t require spaces, brackets or anything else—let the user enter their phone number as they please.

The best way to convert users isn’t necessarily to design better error messages, but rather to prevent those error messages from occurring in the first place.

Many forms make you fill out your password and then confirm it, and they usually mask the password as well. 
You can experiment with showing the latest character typed in a password (great for big fingers and small screens on mobile).
You can also just give the user the option to see their password as they type it.



### Don’t use infield labels

Labels inside the field can look like pre-filled answers.
Using labels as placeholder text inside the field (where users know the answer normally goes) interrupts the conversational flow.
If the labels disappears as soon as the field receives focus, then screen readers can’t read the label.

# Conclusion

Filling up a form can be frustrating sometimes, and most of the users they switch websites because of the forms. So the best way of creating a form is creating a form that with interact with the users and simplifies everything.
