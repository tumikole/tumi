# Media queries


I spended almost the whole day trying to understand the basics and the format of creating or building up webpage. There were lots of bugs/errors in my project so i was learning how to fix them.

Using media queries i'm still struggling. To make my web be resposive is a problem for me because  when i try to inspectt uisng my laptop, it freezes and i have to restart the laptop.

But i have read about it today and making sure that i understand what is media queries (Media queries is a feature of CSS 3 allowing content rendering to adapt to different conditions such as screen resolution (e.g. mobile and desktop screen size).


## Standard Resolution


320px — 480px: Mobile devices.
481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets.
769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops.
1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens.
1201px and more — Extra large screens, TV.


## Also learned on the internet that:


Let content determine breakpoints.
Treat layout as an enhancement.
Use major and minor breakpoints.
Use relative units.
Go beyond width.
Use media queries for conditional loading.
Don't go overboard

###### So im using this as a reminder for feature reference

Didnt have time to do freecodecamp today...
