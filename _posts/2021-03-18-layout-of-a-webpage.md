# Grid layout

CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives. Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows.

In web design, grid systems are invisible structures that collect all the elements within a web page together. ... a structure (usually two-dimensional) made up of a series of intersecting straight (vertical,horizontal, and angular) or curved guide lines used to structure content.

Grid layout: was built with responsiveness in mind, it takes less code than eriting media queries.


# Flexbox Layout

To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid , set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows , and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row . Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn't matter.

CSS flexbox layout allows you to easily format HTML. Flexbox makes it simple to align items vertically and horizontally using rows and columns. Items will "flex" to different sizes to fill the space. It makes responsive design easier.
flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.
