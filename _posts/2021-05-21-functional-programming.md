# Introduction.

I just started functional programming and i basically dont understand fp. So i used google search so that i can get better understanding.

Those first-class functions are what makes functional programming possible in JavaScript. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language that allows you to freely mix and match object-oriented, procedural, and functional paradigms. Recently there has been a growing trend toward functional programming.

## What is meant by functional programming?

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. ... This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.

## Why is functional programming?

### Advantages Of Functional Programming

It helps us to solve problems effectively in a simpler way. It improves modularity. It allows us to implement lambda calculus in our program to solve complex problems. Some programming languages support nested functions which improve maintainability of the code.

## What are the disadvantages of functional programming?

### Five Drawbacks/Downsides of Functional Programming

1. Input/output (IO) IO relies on side effects, so it's inherently non-functional. ...
2. Recursion.
3. Terminology problems.
4. The non-functionality of computers. 
5. The difficulty of stateful programming.
6. Abstraction is powerful. 
7. It's inherently parallel.
8. It's easily testable/debuggable.
