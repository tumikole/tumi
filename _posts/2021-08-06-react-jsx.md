## JSX Elements

JSX it is a greater tool to render the UI OF MODERN Web applications. One important thing about JSX is that it must return a single element.
ex:
<div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>

This is a valid JSX. multiple elements are wrapped within a parent div element.
If you remove the div, JSX will no longer transpile.

For readability, you might need to add comments to your code.
we use {/**/} to write comments.

With react, we can render JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React rendering API known as ReactDOM.
ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React Elements to the DOM. 

ex:
ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)
