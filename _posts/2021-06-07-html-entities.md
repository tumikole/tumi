## What does HTML entities

### Definition and Usage

The htmlentities() function converts characters to HTML entities. To convert HTML entities back to characters, use the html entity decode() function. Use the get html translation table() function to return the translation table used by htmlentities().

## What are the character entities

A character entity reference is an SGML construct that references a character of the document character set. The names of the entities are taken from the appendices of SGML (defined in [ISO8879]). symbols, mathematical symbols, and Greek letters. These characters may be represented by glyphs in the Adobe font "Symbol".

## Should I use HTML entities

Generally, you don't need to use HTML entities if your editor supports Unicode. For some instances, entities can be useful. Your editor does not support Unicode. Your keyboard does not support the character you would like to type, such as em-dash or the copyright symbol.
