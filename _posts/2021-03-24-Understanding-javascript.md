## What is JavaScript

JavaScript is an object orient programming language designed to make web development easier and more attractive. In most cases, JavaScript is used to create responsive, interactive elements for web pages, enhancing the user experience.

## What is it used for

JavaScript allows you to take ordinary web elements and make them interactive. It can be used alongside your HTML and CSS and is an extremely important tool for any web developer.

### commenting out

In JavaScript we have  in-line comment and mult-line comment.

Multyline comment start with /* and end with */. Multi-line comment, comment out the whole text between the /* and */. You can write as many text as you like in between multi-line comment and it wont be recorgnised/read by the web.

### We have 7 data types

boolean, strings, numbers, null, undefined, object and symbols

String are just any sort of text.
Numbers are just numbers.
undefined is something that has not been defined.
Null means nothing.
Boolean means true/false.
symbol is a primitive data type in JavaScript and TypeScript, which, amongst other things, can be used for object properties.
Object can store lot of key value pairs.

three ways of declaring variable
var key word stand for variable and can change,
eg: 
var myName = "tumi";
    myName = 8;

let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used

const is a variable that should not change, and you you try to change it, you will grt an error.

Difference between declaring variables and assighing Variables

example of assigning a variable
var a;

example of declaring and assigning variables in one line
var b = 2;

You end all lines in JS with semicolons
