## Introduction

### Today im going to do javascript course "recap". From the freecodecamp we learned about the basics of Javascript, esc6, regular expressions, debugging, basic data structures, badic algorithm scripting, OOP, functional programming and etc... You learn to work with arrays, objects, function, loops... etc

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
Object-Oriented Programming is a way of writing code that allows you to create different objects from a common object. The common object is usually called a blueprint while the created objects are called instances. Each instance has properties that are not shared with other instances.

## Body


in Basic Js you learn the fundamental programming concerpts.

ES6 brought significant changes to the JavaScript language. It introduces several new features such as, block-scoped variables, new loop for iterating over arrays and objects, template literals, and many other enhancements to make JavaScript programming easier and more fun.

regex is a string of text that allows you to create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text. Perl is a great example of a programming language that utilizes regular expressions.


Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. To prevent incorrect operation of a software or system, debugging is used to find and resolve bugs or defects.

Basic data structure-JavaScript has primitive and non-primitive data structures. Primitive data structures and data types are native to the programming language. These include boolean, null, number, string, etc. These include linear data structures, static data structures, and dynamic data structures, like queue and linked lists.
