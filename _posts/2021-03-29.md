### concatenate strings

When we concatenate strings, we use the plus (+) operator and also the (+=)operator. (+=) operator we use it to break long strings over several lines.

You can concatenate (+) operator by inserting one or more variables into a string you are building.

### Finding length if a strings

The length property returns the length of a string: The length property of an object which is an instance of type Array sets or returns the number of elements in that array. 
Strings are immutable, which means they cannot be altered once they are created. 
You cannot change the single character but can change string by assigning them to a new string

### Using Bracket notation.

#### TO find the nth character of a sring

In JS/conputer, we count from zero. Zero is the first character.

### To find the last character in as tring

You substract [- 1] one in a strings length

### tp find the nth-to-lst charecter in a string

remember that when finding the last letter, we count from -1 becuase theres no -0. So from the rigt the index start from -1.

##### Doing my research on google and other search platforms to get better understanding.
