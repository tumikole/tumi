#### Building structure of a webpage using html is not a problem for me, applying css is not that very difficult. Im struggling with javascript "functions". The reason why im struggling with java script is because im still busy with freecodecamp and im not yet at the functions. but with the help from external sources, i managed to apply functions and help me to see how the functions work.
