Title: "Use Array.map() to Dynamically Render Elements"

### (freecodecamp)
Conditional rendering is useful, but you may need your components to render an unknown number of elements. Often in reactive programming, a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program. Programmers need to write their code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time.

### What is array.map

Array.map calls the provided function, on every element in the array, and creates a new array of the subsequent results of each call.

## How do I map an array in React

To use the map() function, attach it to an array you want to iterate over. The map() function expects a callback as the argument and executes it once for each element in the array. From the callback parameters, you can access the current element, the current index, and the array itself.

ex:


const people = [
  { id: 1, name: "Johnny", gender: "male", age: 30 },
  { id: 2, name: "Jenny", gender: "female", age: 28 },
  { id: 3, name: "Sam", gender: "male", age: 13 },
  { id: 4, name: "Dean", gender: "male", age: 8 }
];

The answer is, you use Array.map() in your component and return JSX elements inside the Array.map() callback function to render the UI.

Hereâ€™s an example how to use Array.map() in React.


<ul>
  {people.map(person => {
    return (
      <li key={person.id}>
        {person.name} - {person.age} years old
      </li>
    )
  })}
</ul>
