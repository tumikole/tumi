# Calling functions: missing opening and closing parentheses, Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order, Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing

## Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call

Remember to add opening and closing parentheses when calling a function.
FunctionName + (). 

## Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order 

The function must be called specifically with variables in the correct order. Otherwise the function will mix up both variables and return an undesired answer.
Make sure the variable power is implementing the raiseToPower function correctly.

## Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition

To prevent an infinite loop, the while-condition must reach a terminal condition to exit out of the loop.

# Basic Data Structure

### Having problem with understing the following:

###### Copy an Array with the Spread Operator
###### Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator

###### Iterate Through All an Array's Items Using For Loops

Most of todays time i spended on Basic Data Structure Coourse. Describes

Basic Data Structures courses has been hard for me to understand it. I went Through this course all over and all again but it was difficult for me to understand it. But i will keep on practicing until i get it right.
